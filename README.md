# 📝 Firebase Todo App with Authentication

This project was assigned by my mentor as a learning task.  
I built a **Todo List application** using **Next.js** and **Firebase**.  
It includes **User Sign Up, Login, Add, and Delete tasks**.  
All tasks are saved in **Firebase Firestore**, and **Firebase Authentication** is used for user login.
